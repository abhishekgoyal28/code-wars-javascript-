# code-wars-javascript-
A basic task using javascript.
### In file "index.html(final code)" is the final code written by me.

### In file name "index.html(base code)" base code is written, use this to complete further programming required.
~ Consider the following game :
  Numbers from 1 to 25 are randomly placed on the maze and the player has to bring them in order only by swapping.
  The only controls allowed are arrow keys and enter key.
  To swap cell A and B, player goes to A and stores the number in A by pressing enter.
  Then goes to B and presses enter again. This will swap the values and storage will become free.

~ You have to write functions to support the needed movements in this game.

~ A random matrix of 25 numbers is given in the JS file. When page loads, these values must be displayed in cells.

~ Use event listeners for keyboard movement.

~ Although you need to write code only in the JS file, you need to read the HTML code and see the class and ids used in maze.

~ I have made a 'active' class to highlight the current cell. You just need to remove and add this class from/to appropriate cell.

~ Cell should become empty when we take its value to storage.

~ Similarly, storage should again become None when swapping is complete.
